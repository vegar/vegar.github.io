<p><img src="http://blog.vi-kan.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/image.png" alt="particle firework" title="particle firework" /> The other day, a colleague and I where looking at a cool application, <a href="http://www.nitrogen.za.org/projectinfo.asp?id=38">Machine Flow</a>. It&#8217;s a visual development environment and interpreter for the programming language Machine Flow. The language it self is defined by small lua-scripts, which you visually connect together. The running of the program is illustrated by small marbles carrying data around. It&#8217;s quite fun to play with, and the source is open, so there should be one or two things to look at there to.</p>

<p>What caught my colleagues interest, was a small firework-effect when the development environment was cleared. So we started discussing it, and soon I was determined to show that it&#8217;s really not that hard to make such effects. Now, I have never before done anything like this before. I lack experience with both graphics programming and the necessary math/physics. But it can&#8217;t be that hard, can it?</p>

<p>Well, we&#8217;ll just have to wait and see, then. The first challenge will be to get something unto the screen, and than I can start look at how to make it look nice. I will try to steer away from available libraries and tutorials, and rather come up with something completely on my own. The visual part will require  some reading though…</p>
