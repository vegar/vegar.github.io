<p><img src="http://blog.vi-kan.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/image.png" alt="Owner drawn popup menu" title="Owner drawn popup menu" /> Just when I was thinking that what this blog really needed was some content, an <a href="http://delphi.about.com/od/vclusing/a/2007ownerdraw.htm">old article</a> that I wrote for delphi.about.com was pulled out unto the frontpage again. It was written back when Office 2007 was still in beta, but the principles of owner drawn components should still be the same.</p>

<p>You can take a look at it on the delphi.about.com-page: <a href="http://delphi.about.com/od/vclusing/a/2007ownerdraw.htm">How to Mimic Office 2007 Rich Menus using Owner Drawn TMenuItems</a></p>
