<p>I have always used  <a href="http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/">Alex Gorbatchevs SyntaxHighlighter</a> to make code listings look pretty on this blog. There are <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/search.php?q=syntaxhighlighter">several wordpress plugins</a> that include these scripts automatically. It has one shortcoming, though. It doesn&#8217;t include any syntax highlighter for objective-c. When searching the net for some tips on how to add this feature, I found yet another wordpress plugin, <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/syntaxhighlighter/">SyntaxHighlighter Evolved</a>, and this one included some additional languages, including objective-c. Great! Whats not so great, though, is that instead of using the pre-tag, it uses custom -tags. I guess there will be more difficult to switch between plugins in the feature…</p>
