<p><img src="http://blog.vi-kan.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/letsgo-thumb.png" alt="What a journy this will be!" title="What a journy this will be!" />And then I started blogging. Well, at least I intend to. I guess the future will tell if the first post should have been rewritten to something like &#8216;And then I blogged. Once.&#8217;</p>

<p>So why start blogging? I really don&#8217;t know for sure. I&#8217;ve been told, that every developer should have a blog, but I&#8217;m kind of glad that not everybody have. Well, think about it. Think about all the crazy hits you would get on google for instance.</p>

<p>So if I&#8217;m not sure why I should blog, do I know what I will blog about? At least I think I know. It has to be about what I do, and what I do most, is programming. I have been programming delphi for a living for about ten years, now, and I think I&#8217;m starting to get the hang of it. It&#8217;s not impossible that I would like to share some of what I have learned these years, and it&#8217;s quite likeable that I will share something about what I&#8217;m trying to learn, or what I would really like to learn in the future.</p>

<p>For instance, right now, I have a personal goal to become a certified .net developer before the summer. I&#8217;m not sure that this will work out for me yet, cause the spring is coming along, and there are a lot more to learn. But we will see. Hopefully I will come through knowing a lot more about .net then I used to either way.</p>

<p>And then there is reading. I love to read. I just need something to put my eyes on whenever it&#8217;s time for it. I&#8217;m a slow reader, though, so a book can last for weeks. I read mostly tech books, but from time to time I sneak in some fiction. What ever it is, maybe I will share my thoughts about it here when I&#8217;m finished?</p>

<p>And that leads to a significant reason for having a blog. Have you ever encountered a competition or price offering demanding a reference to your blog? &#8216;All you got to do, is mention us on your blog, and give us the link, and we will offer you great prices&#8217;. Expect to see a lot of mentioning in the feature…</p>

<p>So beside programming and books, there may be some other things that I want to share. It may be something oriented towards technology, or it may be something about one of my other hobbies, e.g. photography. Or my family. We will see.</p>
